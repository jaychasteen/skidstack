# skidstack

#### A customizable, deployable application for the sharing of information and expertise.
#### Also, a running website for general use by retail professionals

## System Abstract

The StackOverflow model works very well to help people get the answers they need.
There is a need for a similar exchange platform for the retail industry.
People who work in retail may have no one at their workplace to rely on for answers and/or advice.
The StackExchange family of sites seems to work because people are rewarded with reputation for their contributions.

In addition to a forum, the skidstack software package will offer optional applications.
Initial Apps:
* Data graphing, table-formatting, and presention
* Document version control, with comments, issues and pull requests.
* Social Media with profiles, posts (with comments), private messaging.

Skidstack will offer OAuth login via Google and Microsoft or via local auth.
